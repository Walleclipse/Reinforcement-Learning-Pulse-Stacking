# Combining the power of reinforcement learning and stochastic parallel gradient decent for optimizing the delay lines of pulse stacking

In this paper, we firstly incorporate momentum into Stochastic Parallel Gradient Descent (SPGD) to create the algorithm called SPGDM. By incorporating  SPGDM with SAC Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), one of the stable reinforcement learning, to propose a robust and fast algorithm algorithms called SAC-SPGDM, we simulated the coherent pulse stacking of 128 pulses by delay line controlling and stabilization. The experiment proved its feasibility and demonstrated it a robust and fast controller. 

Code will be released soon.
