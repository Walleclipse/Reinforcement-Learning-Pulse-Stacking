# Combining the power of reinforcement learning and stochastic parallel gradient decent for optimizing the delay lines of pulse stacking

*Department of Electronics, Peking University*

In this paper, we incorporate momentum into Stochastic Parallel Gradient Descent (SPGD) to create the algorithm called SPGDM. By incorporating  SPGDM with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), one of the stable reinforcement learning, we propose a robust and fast algorithm called SAC-SPGDM. We simulated the coherent pulse stacking of 128 pulses by delay line controlling and stabilization. The experiment proved its feasibility and demonstrated it as a robust and fast controller. 

Code will be released soon.
