# Learning-based robust control algorithms for coherent pulse stacking

*A. Abuduweili,..., Z. Zhang et al.*

For the fast and robust control of the delay lines for coherent pulse stacking, we combined the Stochastic Parallel Gradient Descent with momentum (SPGDM) and the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) into a powerful algorithm SAC-SPGDM. The simulation shows that the algorithm can find the optimal delay-line positions to ensure the 128 pulses coherently stacked for 7-stage pulses stacking within 25 steps. 

Experimental results and demonstrations are available at [demo](demo).
