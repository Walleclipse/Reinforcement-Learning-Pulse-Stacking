# Robust control algorithms for coherent pulse stacking


For the fast and robust control of the delay lines for coherent pulse stacking, we combined the Stochastic Parallel Gradient Descent with momentum (SPGDM) and the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) into a powerful algorithm SAC-SPGDM. 

Experimental results and demonstrations are available at [demo](demo).
