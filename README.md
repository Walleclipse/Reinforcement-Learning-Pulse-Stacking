# Robust non-convex control algorithms for coherent pulse stacking

*A. Abuduweili,..., Z. Zhang et al.*

For the fast and robust control of the delay lines for coherent pulse stacking, we combined the Stochastic Parallel Gradient Descent with momentum (SPGDM) and the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) into a powerful algorithm SAC-SPGDM. The simulation shows that the algorithm can quickly achieve the optimal delay-line positions for 7-stage 128 pulses stacking within 20 steps.

Code will be released soon.

Experimental results and demonstrations are available at [demo](demo).
